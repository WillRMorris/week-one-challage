# week-one-challenge

- I fixed up the HTML focusing on the excessive divs and classes/ids. 
- using semantics I broke down the various divs into a clearer system of headers, sections, articles, and footers.
- narrowed several classes into one for both the content section and the benefits section to simplify CSS.
- gave all the images IDs hopefully helpful to screen readers to increase accessability. 
- gave the website a comprehensive title that should be optomised for search engines.
- overall focused accessability for both user and provider.
